## What is curve stitching?
  Curve Stitching ([Google is your friend](https://www.google.com/search?q=curve-stitching)) aka "[string art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_art)" is a mathematical art form in which the artist creates curves through the intersection of several straight lines. 
The more lines that are used, the smoother a curve looks, as well as increasing the "gradient" effect caused by the greater density of lines near the curve itself.
